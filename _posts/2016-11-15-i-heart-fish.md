After learning that a good friend would "rather go to prison than use bash", I decided to finally give fish a try. (Fish as in [fish](https://fishshell.com), his preferred shell.)

Most of my developer friends use bash (some of the more hardcore ones use zsh), and personally I have been using bash almost every day since I was a teenager. Despite all of its shortcomings, I have grown fond of it -- besides my browser, it's probably the place I spend the most time in. But having used fish for a few months as my default shell, I am now a convert, and likely will remain one.

Fish comes with a whole bunch of features. Most are available for bash as well, but with fish they all work out of the box (with no configuration needed).

The ones I like best are the **autosuggestions** and the **tab completion**. Fish suggests commands in a smart way, based on your history, previous completion picks, and valid file paths (including [implicit cd](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/22)). As you type a command, you'll see the suggestion right after the cursor, in gray. To accept, you only need to press right arrow.

Fish will also make a great guess whenever you press `<tab>`. If there is more than one completion, you can tab through all the possible ones. And when you do it for a command line option, it integrates with the man pages, showing all the available switches. It also does lots and lots of general purpose and program-specific [completions](http://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html#completion) (git, mount, ssh, su, ...).

Further features include:

- No hidden settings, all the special features are on by default
- Colors (256 of them), for extra visual feedback
- A very long command history
- Skips duplicates in your history
- For partial commands, the up arrow shows matching commands from your history only
- Wildcards
- A web based configuration interface
- It's fast
- A great [design document](http://fishshell.com/docs/current/design.html) outlining their design philosophy
- Backward history search (similar to ctrl+r in bash) using [re-search](https://github.com/jbonjean/re-search)

[Oh my fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) is also a cool framework for the fish shell, adding such things as git integration (showing your current branch/git status), themes, and the [z](https://github.com/rupa/z) plugin, a great tool that allows you to navigate to your most used directories using fuzzy commands.

Overall this shell is "the next level of convenience" ([Daniel Wehner](https://twitter.com/da_wehner/status/598589852888801282)), and a pleasure to use. It's here to stay for me, and I strongly encourage you to [give it a try](https://fishshell.com/#platform_tabs) as well.
